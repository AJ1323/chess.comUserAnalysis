## Chess.com user opening chart
# Author: Austin Morris
# Date: April 04, 2025


This was started as a way to see if the player was on a current winning or losing streak(hence that portion of the name) However it pivoted to an analysis of openings by the player. Enter a valid chess.com username(it is case sensitive) into the search bar and click the 'search' button. This will allow you to see the openings most commonly played by or won with the provided chess.com user.

# Profile Picture
The profile picture when clicked will open a new window to the chess.com profile of the username put into the search bar.
# Stats
This will show the ratings both current and best as well as the overall record of 3 game types: blitz, rapid, and daily.
# Chart
The charts will display by default the 10 most played openings by the user. There are options to display the top 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 by either most played with or with the highest win rate. You can also search for a specific opening or it will display the openings that contain the keyword entered if they exist. If they are none that match the chart will be empty.


# Things to improve
1) When no openings match the keyword should not display an empty chart but should just display text stating that there are no matches.
2) Make the opening url that appears below chart when one is selected clickable to open window to chess.com opening.
3) Make the search bar work with the enter key so that it is not necessary to click the search button.
4) Aesthetics, improving size and location of searchbar and search button, color, look of the stats.
5) Add a strictly results chart that just shows wins and losses over a certain number of games.
6) Add a suggested opening to play against the user based on their most used or highest winning openings.
