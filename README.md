# Streaking-
Was originally going to be used to tell whether a chess.com player was currently on a winning or losing streak. However, it is going to be used for more than that. 

## GameScraper.py 
This is where the functions for calling the PubAPI are located. There are 4 options that will return 4 different JSON objects for a given user.

## JSONparser

This will parse the JSON objects returned from GameScraper and return only the wanted information as a string object.
